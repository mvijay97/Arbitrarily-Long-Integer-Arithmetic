# Arbitrarily-Long-Integer-Arithmetic
Library to perform arithmetic operations on Integers of arbitrary length

This library supports the following operations on arbitrarily long integers -
* Create an aribitratily long integer given its string representation 
* Increment the integer
* Decrement the integer
* Add two integers
* Subtract two integers
* Multipliy two integers (using the Karatsuba Algorithm)
* Divide two integers
* Compare two integers
* Computer the power function

Run the intal.c file to experiment with the library
